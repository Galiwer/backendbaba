# Railway Hostname Fix

## üö® Issue Identified

The debug log shows:
```
DEBUG: MYSQLHOST = backendbaba.railway.internal
```

But it should be:
```
DEBUG: MYSQLHOST = mysql.railway.internal
```

## üîç Problem Analysis

Railway is using a service-specific internal hostname instead of the generic `mysql.railway.internal`. This happens when:

1. **MySQL service name** is different from "mysql"
2. **Railway's internal networking** uses service-specific hostnames
3. **Service discovery** is not working as expected

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Solution 1: Use External Connection (Recommended)

1. **Get external MySQL connection details**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your MySQL service
   - Go to "Connect" tab
   - Copy the external connection details

2. **Set environment variables manually**:
   ```
   MYSQLHOST=tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
   MYSQLPORT=42634
   MYSQLUSER=root
   MYSQLPASSWORD=ElBlPtqKfjEFfDBjcYzwfuqcTVTzEHCl
   MYSQLDATABASE=railway
   ```

3. **Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Solution 2: Fix Internal Hostname

1. **Check MySQL service name** in Railway dashboard
2. **Use the correct internal hostname**:
   ```
   MYSQLHOST=backendbaba.railway.internal
   ```
   (Use whatever hostname Railway is actually providing)

3. **Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

### Solution 3: Use MYSQL_URL

1. **Set MYSQL_URL environment variable**:
   ```
   MYSQL_URL=mysql://root:ElBlPtqKfjEFfDBjcYzwfuqcTVTzEHCl@tramway.proxy.rlwy.net:42634/railway
   ```

2. **Redeploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

## üöÄ Quick Fix Commands

### Check Current Environment
```bash
railway logs
```

### Set External Connection Variables
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, set these variables:
MYSQLHOST=tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
MYSQLPORT=42634
MYSQLUSER=root
MYSQLPASSWORD=ElBlPtqKfjEFfDBjcYzwfuqcTVTzEHCl
MYSQLDATABASE=railway
```

### Redeploy
```bash
railway up
```

## üìã Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**
2. **Click on your backend service**
3. **Go to "Variables" tab**
4. **Add/Update these variables**:
   ```
   MYSQLHOST=tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
   MYSQLPORT=42634
   MYSQLUSER=root
   MYSQLPASSWORD=ElBlPtqKfjEFfDBjcYzwfuqcTVTzEHCl
   MYSQLDATABASE=railway
   ```
5. **Save changes**
6. **Redeploy**: `railway up`

## üîß Why This Happens

- Railway's internal networking can be inconsistent
- Service names affect internal hostnames
- External connections are more reliable
- Railway's internal DNS resolution can have issues

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After fixing, you should see:
```
DEBUG: MYSQLHOST = tramway.proxy.rlwy.net
Connecting to Railway MySQL and creating database if needed: railway
Database connection successful
```

## üéØ Recommendation

**Use external connection** (`tramway.proxy.rlwy.net`) as it's more reliable than internal hostnames.
